# STM32 LED Reaction Game

This project implements a reaction game on an STM32 microcontroller where an LED flashes at random intervals. The goal is to press a button while the LED is lit. If you succeed, the LED's next flash duration will be shorter. If you fail, the flash duration will be longer.

## Features
- LED flashes at random intervals.
- Button press detection while the LED is lit.
- Adaptive flash duration based on user response.
